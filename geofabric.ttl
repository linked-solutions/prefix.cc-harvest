                "All contracted catchment features of type ContractedArea are aggregations of the\r\nAHGFCatchment units that participate in a relationship of common geographic extent based\r\nupon the location of a contracted node from both Geofabric Surface Cartography and\r\nGeofabric Surface Network or a data sink as defined within the DEM-1S. Levels of confidence\r\nfor contracted nodes are further described in the following section of the Geofabric Product\r\nGuide.\r\n\r\nEach ContractedArea is assigned with the contracted node identifier (ConNodeID) and the\r\nconfidence level (ConLevel) of the contracted node to which they drain. The ContractedArea\r\nfeatures are the drainage areas of a combination of Levels 1 and 2 contracted nodes. These\r\ndrainage areas also incorporate catchment areas where there is no discernable flow (at\r\n1:250,000 scale) in the form of stream flow segment features. The allocation of no flow areas\r\nto contracted catchments is performed based on the most likely destination of water falling in\r\nthese areas in flood type conditions. \r\n\r\nContracted catchment hierarchy\r\n\r\nIn previous versions of the Geofabric, the set of contracted catchment features provided a\r\ncollection of drainage areas for a set of persistent contracted nodes. In V2.1 these areas have\r\nbeen further processed to aggregate these features into a contracted catchment hierarchy.\r\nThis hierarchy of contracted catchments includes only those catchments for key contracted\r\nnodes taken from a full set of contractible river confluences, sinks, monitoring points and the\r\ninflow and outflow points of water storages. These key contracted nodes form a stable,\r\nlogical, dendritic hierarchy of catchments that can be reliably reproduced when moving to\r\nhigher resolution or larger scaled data. The contracted catchment hierarchy provides a\r\nreliable and stable set of catchments that, among other things, can be mapped to a number\r\nof types of water reporting areas (depending on the use case) as exemplified by the stable\r\nreporting regions given in Hydrology Reporting Regions." ;
